# SEP740 - McMaster University

This repository contains code and clarifications for the SEP740 course at McMaster University, taught by Professor Sayyed Faridoddin Afzali. The purpose of this repository is to help other students by fixing errors in the provided teaching materials, as some of them are not runnable in their original form.

## Environment Setup

This project is developed using `pyenv` to manage Python environments. The specific environment setup is as follows:

- Python version: `anaconda3-2024.06-1` (installed via `pyenv`)
- Ensure `pyenv` is installed and properly configured on your system.
- A `.python-version` file is included in this repository. If you have `anaconda3-2024.06-1` installed, `pyenv` will automatically activate this version when you enter the project directory.
- To install the required Python version manually:
  ```sh
  pyenv install anaconda3-2024.06-1
  ```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sep740-fixes.git
   cd sep740-fixes
   ```

2. Ensure the correct Python environment is active (this should happen automatically if `pyenv` is configured correctly):
   ```sh
   pyenv activate anaconda3-2024.06-1
   ```

3. Run the corrected scripts as needed.
